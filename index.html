                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <h4>Welcome to SeizurEShield, where we harness the power of machine learning to provide advanced
                    solutions for epilepsy care. </h4>
                <p>Our goal is to empower individuals with epilepsy through advanced machine learning solutions to
                    detect and predict seizure activity, enhancing their quality of life and ensuring their dignity and
                    safety.</p>

            <h2>Project Statement</h2>
            <p>About 1 in 10 people will experience a seizure in their lifetime, and for some, these seizures become a
                chronic problem called epilepsy. Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures that can range in both
                frequency and severity and currently affects an estimated 50 million people worldwide, making it one of
                the most common neurological disorders globally next to Alzheimer’s (55 million) and Parkinson’s (10
                million). It’s caused by a variety of things like traumatic brain injuries, strokes, genetic
                inheritance, and even severe infections, making it difficult to prevent.</p>
            <p>However, what makes epilepsy so difficult to live with is its unpredictability. While approximately 65%
                of people with generalized epilepsy report “getting auras,” or feelings that can warn you if a seizure
                is about to happen, many people don’t experience those – there’s also 4 other types of epilepsy in
                addition. This means that at any given point in time a seizure could just happen with very little
                warning, and the impact of that seizure could range from time loss (absence seizures) to convulsions,
                complete unconsciousness, and immediate hospitalization (grand-mal seizures).</p>
            <p>Ultimately, this problem presents both quality of life (always needing to be accompanied, restrictions on
                driving/etc.) and safety concerns (what if you’re standing when a seizure hits and you fall/get
                injured?) that can infringe on a person’s ability to even do something like going outside for a walk by
                themselves.</p>
            <p>Most medicines do not have a complete 100% success rate for treating medical problems, and medications
                used to treat epilepsy are no exception to this rule. Thus, we’d like to propose the use of deep or
                machine learning techniques to first attempt to detect, and then possibly predict, seizure activity from
                EEG recordings of the human brain.

            <h2>Project Outline</h2>
            <p>Our project, SeizurEShield, focuses on developing an algorithm to detect seizure activity from EEG
                recordings using advanced machine learning techniques. Key features of our project include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing Pipeline:</strong> Extracting and normalizing features from raw EEG
                    signals.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Implementing logistic regression, SVM, CNN, and/or LSTM
                    models for seizure detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> Allowing users to upload EEG files and view results on our
                    website.</li>
                <li><strong>Backend API Development:</strong> Creating a Flask application to enable endpoints for
                    real-time data processing
                    and seizure detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation and Optimization:</strong> Using performance metrics to tune and optimize our
                    models.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our project aims to provide accurate seizure detection insights to aid in timely medical intervention and
                reduce the manual effort required by neurologists.</p>
