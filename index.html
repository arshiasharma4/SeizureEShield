            <h2>Project Outline</h2>
            <p>Our project, SeizurEShield, focuses on developing an algorithm to detect seizure activity from EEG recordings using advanced machine learning techniques. Key features of our project include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing Pipeline:</strong> Extracting and normalizing features from raw EEG signals.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Implementing logistic regression, SVM, CNN, and/or LSTM models for seizure detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> Allowing users to upload EEG files and view results on our website.</li>
                <li><strong>Backend API Development:</strong> Creating RESTful endpoints for real-time data processing and predictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation and Optimization:</strong> Using performance metrics to tune and optimize our models.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our goal is to provide accurate seizure detection insights to aid in timely medical intervention and reduce the manual effort required by neurologists.</p>
